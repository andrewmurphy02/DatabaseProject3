This project involved the creation of a web-based Job Application Tracking System to manage students applying for jobs with multiple companies. I used a Java and PHP backend and an HTML frontend. The web application is comprised of six functional pages, each catering to a specific task. 

1. Add Student: Allows users to add new students to the students table. 
2. Add Job: Users can add new job listings to the Jobs table using this page. 
3. Add Application: Users can create application records by linking students to specific job positions.
4. View Students by Major: Users can view all students by selecting a specific Major in a drop-down box.
5. View Jobs by Major: Users can view all jobs available by selecting a specific Major in a drop-down box.
6. View Applications: This page has different options to view applications based on special criteria.

Additionally, a Home Page is used as a central hub that allows the user to navigate to and from the six pages.
